# DL5-Music-Detector

This application is able to predict and play simple* sheet music, using Deep Learning technology (YOLOV3) and PyQt for the interface.

Simple, meaning:
- Only in C Major (No key signatures)
- Only one-handed playing (No bass clef)
- No accidentals
- Only quarter, half and whole notes.
Might get upgraded in the future :)

This was done for my Final Project in Deep Learning (10 Units Computer Science).
